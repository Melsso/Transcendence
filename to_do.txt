NEW BUGS ta3 lyoum:
changing your name, then trying to rename to the same username you had y9ollek you're using the same shit
pressing 'enter' when you're typing inside a field f settings basically refreshes the website ??
uploading a picture that's too big gives you an error: undefined
deleting all games doesnt remove the field to type password

guest account tests:

clicking on friends list opens it and throws a notif, make it be unable to open the friends accordeon if possible
clicking it to close also throws a notif
you can find guest accounts if you search them, you can even send a friend request to them from a normal account.
losing a game or winning a game grants you exp as a guest account ??
losing gets you an error message, add error message here: Guest_cf909bdb cannot read properties of null //
when oyu win it writes null exp.

pongloc tests:
pressing replay will spawn the ball somewhere around where it hit when you initially lost, so yeah ball.x and ball.y to be reset after game ends

ai tests:
leaving a game gives you notif, but nothing for match history
